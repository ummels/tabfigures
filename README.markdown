tabfigures - Using tabular figures with LaTeX
=============================================

The tabfigures package is a collection of patches for using
tabular figures in some LaTeX environments where numbers should
line up vertically such as the table of contents and enumerations.

Usage
-----

To use this package, include

    \usepackage[<options>]{tabfigures}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the PDF documentation for
the available options and other details.

Installation
------------

To install the package and its documentation in your home texmf tree, run:

    make install

If you want to use a different texmf tree, you can specify it using the
variable TEXMFDIR:

    make install TEXMFDIR=/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash
